## Important Notes

### For Code:

- All code prior to September 4, 2025 remains available under its original license (MIT or GPL as applicable from historical commits)
- New code contributions from September 4, 2025 forward are licensed under AGPL v3 only
- Forks and derivative works MUST comply with AGPL v3 terms
- Historical MIT-licensed code remains available under MIT from previous commits

### Legal Considerations:

- The AGPL's network copyleft provisions are stronger than GPL v3
- When combining code, the most restrictive compatible license applies to the combined work
- Consult legal counsel for specific compliance questions
